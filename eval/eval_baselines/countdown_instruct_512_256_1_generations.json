We can start by trying to combine the numbers in different ways that might lead us to the target.\n\n1. Let's try by adding the numbers:\n   - \\(90 + 70 = 160\\)\n   - \\(90 + 30 = 120\\)\n   - \\(70 + 30 = 100\\)\n\n2. Next, try subtracting the numbers:\n   - \\(90 - 70\\) (since \\(90 - 70 = 20\\))\n   - \\(90 - 30\\) (since \\(90 - 30 = 60\\))\n   - \\(70 - 30\\) (since \\(70 - 30 = 40\\))\n\n3. Now, let's try multiplying:\n   - \\(90 \\times 70 = 6300\\)\n   - \\(90 \\times 30 = 2700\\)\n   - \\(70 \\times 30 = 2100\\)\n\n4. Finally, let's try dividing:\n   - \\(90 \\div 70 = 1.2285714285714286\\)\n   - \\(90 \\div 30 = 3\\)\n   - \\(70 \\div 30 = 2\\)333333...\n\nWe notice that, but none of these combinations directly give us 10. However, we can try a different approach by considering the numbers in a different way. Let's try using the numbers in a way that might lead us to 10.\n\nOne possible is to use the numbers in a way that might lead us to 10.
