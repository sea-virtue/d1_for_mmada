'0' represents empty cells.\n\n2. **Analyze the grid**:\n   - The first row: 4, 3, 0, 2.\n   - The second row: 0, 0, 4, 3.\n   - The third row: 3, 0, 2, 0.\n   - The fourth row: 2, 0, 0, 0.\n\n3. **Fill the grid**:\n   - Start with the first row: 4, 3, 0, 2.\n   - Fill the second row: 0, 0, 4, 3.\n   - Fill the third row: 3, 0, 2, 0.\n   - Fill the fourth row: 2, 0, 0, 0.\n\n4. **Check the columns**:\n   - The first column: 4, 0, 3, 2.\n   - The second column: 3, 4, 0, 0.\n   - The third column: 0, 3, 2, 0.\n   - The fourth column: 2, 0, 0, 0.\n\n5. **Check the 2x2 boxes**:\n   - The first 2x2 box: 4, 3, 0, 2.\n   - The second 2x2 box: 0, 0, 4, 3.\n   - The third 2x2 box: 3, 0, 2, 0.\n   - The fourth 2x2 box: 2, 0, 0, 0.\n\nSince each row, column, and 2x2 box contains the digits 1-4 exactly once, the puzzle is solved correctly.\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>\n4302004330202000\n</answer><|eot_id|><|endoftext|>",
