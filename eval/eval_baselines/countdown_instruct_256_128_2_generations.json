We can start by trying to combine the numbers in different ways that might lead us to the target.\n\nFirst, let's try adding the numbers:\n- \\( 21 + 39 + 89 = 149 \\)\n\nThis is not equal to the target. Next, let's try multiplying the numbers:\n- \\( 21 \\times 39 = 819 \\)\n- \\( 819 \\times 89 = 72791 \\)\n\nThis is not equal to the target. Now, let's try dividing the numbers:\n- \\( 21 \\div 39 = 0{,}53 \\)\n- \\( 0{,}53 \\times 89 = 46{,}17 \\)\n\nThis is not equal to the target.\n\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\n\\boxed{21 - 39 + 89}\n</answer><|eot_id|><|endoftext|>",

We will start by trying to use the numbers in a combination that leads us reach the target.\n\nFirst, let's try using the and operation with operations to see if we can reach the target. We can start by using the largest number,90, and then use to get the next number.\n\n\n\nReasoning \n\n1. Start with the number 90.\n2. Subtract 87 from 90 to get 3.\n3. Now 3 is close to 5, but we need to get 2 more units.\n4. We can use 2 * 2 to get 4.\n5.
