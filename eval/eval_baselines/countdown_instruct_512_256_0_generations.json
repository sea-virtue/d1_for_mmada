We can start by using the largest number (99) and see if we can combine it with the other numbers to get the target.\n\nOne approach is to use the subtraction operation. We can try to subtract 99 from 96, which then gives us -3. Now, we need to find a way to use 10 to adjust the result to 7.\n\nAnother approach is to use the multiplication operation. We can try to multiply 99 by 96, which gives us 9504. Now, we need to find a way to use 10 to adjust the result to 7.\n\nFinally, let's consider the division operation. We can try to divide 99 by 96, which gives us approximately 1.03. Now, we need to find a way to use 10 to adjust the result to 7.\n\nAfter trying different combinations, we realize that we need to use the subtraction operation in a specific way. We can subtract 99 from 96, which gives us -3. Now, we need to find a way to use 10 to adjust the result to 7.\n\nTo do this, we can add 10 to -3, which gives us 7. Now, we need to subtract 3 to get 7.\n\nSo, the final expression is:\n\\[ 10 + (96 - 99) - 3 \\]\n\n</answer>\n<answer>\n\\boxed{10 + (96 - 99) - 3}\n</answer><|eot_id|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>",
