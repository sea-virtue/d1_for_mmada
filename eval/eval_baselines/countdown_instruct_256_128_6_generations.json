We can try to use 7 and 4 to form a number that to 57 will give us 8.\n\nLet's try to use 7 and 4 to form a number that can be added to 57 to get 68. We can multiply 7 and 4 to get 28, and then add 57 to 28 to get 68.\n\nSo, the expression is: 7 * 4 + 57.\n\n<answer>\n\\boxed{7 * 4 + 57}\n</answer><|eot_id|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>",
