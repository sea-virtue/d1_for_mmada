Now, let's try division:\n- \\(35 \\div 52 \\approx 0.67\\)\n- \\(35 \\div 26 \\approx 1.34\\)\n- \\(52 \\div 26 \\approx 1.96\\)\n\nNone of these combinations give us 61. Let's try a different approach by combining the numbers in a different way.\n\nWe can try using the numbers in a combination that might subtraction and addition: Let's try \\(\n35 + 52 - 26 = 61\n\\)\n\nHowever, this seems to be incorrect initially. Let's try another approach:\n\nLet's try \\( the expression \\(\n35 + 52 - 26 = 61\n\\)\n\nHowever, this seems to be incorrect initially.
