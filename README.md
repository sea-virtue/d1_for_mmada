**ðŸ”„Updates:**

* 05-04-2025: We released the diffu-GRPO and eval code.
* 04-11-2025: We released [our paper](https://dllm-reasoning.github.io/media/preprint.pdf) and [project page](https://dllm-reasoning.github.io). Additionally, the SFT code was open-sourced.

## Environment Setup

To setup the environment, run;
```
conda env create -f env.yml
conda activate d1
```


## SFT

We open-source our code to perform completion-only masked SFT for dLLMs. We implement the algorithm proposed in [LLaDA](https://github.com/ML-GSAI/LLaDA), and also provide it below for completeness.

![SFT Algorithm](media/algorithm_sft.png)

The framework follows a similar interface to ðŸ¤— Transformers. `dLLMTrainer` subclasses `Trainer` and overrides the loss computation to implement the diffusion loss. `dLLMDataCollator` extends `DefaultDataCollator` by incorporating a forward noising process applied to each training batch. Additionally, we provide a custom torch dataset, `dLLMSFTDataset`, tailored for completion-only SFT of dLLMs.

To preprocess and tokenize your dataset, you will need to modify `preprocess_dataset`. Presently, it works with the s1K dataset.

SFT results can be reproduced with the command,
```bash
# First go to the SFT directory
cd SFT

CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1,2,3,4 accelerate launch --config_file ddp_config.yaml --main_process_port 29500 --num_processes 2 sft_train.py --grad_accum_steps 4 --batch_size 1 --num_epochs 20 
# this results in effective batch size of 8 = 1 * 2 * 4, where 2 is the number of gpus.
```


## _diffu_-GRPO

The code is inside the `diffu-grpo` directory.

- `diffu-grpo/slurm_scripts` contains the slurm scripts we used to run the RL experiments
- Example bash script for running the RL experiment:
  ```bash
  cd diffu-GRPO
  
  CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 bash run.sh
  ```

RL training curves across four reasoning tasks, with models initialized from Llada-Instruct (with and without SFT on s1K):

## Evaluation

The evaluation code is inside the `eval` directory.

- Run with `bash run_eval.sh`
- The evaluation file will only save the generations; use the parser to calculate accuracy
- For example, baseline generations are in the `eval_baselines` directory. Use `python parse_and_get_acc.py` to print the accuracy.
